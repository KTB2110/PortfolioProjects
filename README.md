# Global Covid Data Exploration Project
This is a personal project using MySQL where I analyzed Global COVID Data from the start of the pandemic to January 2022. 
I found insights on Global Deaths, Infections, etc. and created an interactive tableau visualization to complement the analysis.

# SentimentAnalysis on FINVIZ Data
This is a project that I thoroughly enjoyed making. It scrapes article titles from Finviz.com and performs the sentiment analysis for each individual ticker before generating an easy-to-comprehend visualization of the performance per stock listing. This project makes the use of the Natural Language Processing Python Library, NLTK. 

# Twitter Sentiment Analysis
This project analyzes a particular user's tweets on twitter to generate a visually comprehensible word blob on most frequently used words and creates a visualiztion of how positive/negative the user's tweets are on an average.

# Sales Analysis
This project analyses the number of daily sales of a company. The dataset also has the gender of the purchaser which is used in the data analysis. This project answers questions that include: identifying the date where the company saw a major increase in daily sales, confirming whether or not the change in daily sales is due to a shift in the proportion of male-vs-female customers, etc. It features graphs for visual understanding and statistical tests for accurate investigation.

# Video Games Exploratory Data Analysis (using SQL)
This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis on a video games database that has information pertaining to a video game's developer, the platform it can be played on, the total sales in a certain region, etc. I have found some interesting insights using combinations of these featues to both gain an understanding about the different video games in the database and also to showcase my ability in SQL Commands. There are two parts to this project.

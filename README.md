# Global Covid Data Exploration Project
This is a personal project using MySQL where I analyzed Global COVID Data from the start of the pandemic to January 2022. 
I found insights on Global Deaths, Infections, etc. and created an interactive tableau visualization to complement the analysis.

# SentimentAnalysis on FINVIZ Data
This is a project that I thoroughly enjoyed making. It scrapes article titles from Finviz.com and performs the sentiment analysis for each individual ticker before generating an easy-to-comprehend visualization of the performance per stock listing. This project makes the use of the Natural Language Processing Python Library, NLTK. 

# Twitter Sentiment Analysis
This project analyzes a particular user's tweets on twitter to generate a visually comprehensible word blob on most frequently used words and creates a visualiztion of how positive/negative the user's tweets are on an average.

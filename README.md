# Global Covid Data Exploration Project
This is a personal project using MySQL where I analyzed Global COVID Data from the start of the pandemic to January 2022. 
I found insights on Global Deaths, Infections, etc. and created an interactive tableau visualization to complement the analysis.

# SentimentAnalysis on FINVIZ Data
This is a project that I thoroughly enjoyed making. It scrapes article titles from Finviz.com and performs the sentiment analysis for each individual ticker before generating an easy-to-comprehend visualization of the performance per stock listing. This project makes the use of the Natural Language Processing Python Library, NLTK. 

# Twitter Sentiment Analysis
This project analyzes a particular user's tweets on twitter to generate a visually comprehensible word blob on most frequently used words and creates a visualiztion of how positive/negative the user's tweets are on an average.

# Sales Analysis
This project analyses the number of daily sales of a company. The dataset also has the gender of the purchaser which is used in the data analysis. This project answers questions that include: identifying the date where the company saw a major increase in daily sales, confirming whether or not the change in daily sales is due to a shift in the proportion of male-vs-female customers, etc. It features graphs for visual understanding and statistical tests for accurate investigation.
